# This script gathers all of the binaries and libraries needed to run Meteor,
# but which aren't part of a normal Meteor bundle.
#
# We pull Node.js from the Meteor tools installation.
#
# We build a custom MongoDB binary using a special fork of Mongo which creates
# much smaller databases. This is necessary because Mongo by default
# pre-allocates many megabytes of space, but Sandstorm app instances should be
# individual documents and therefore small. (It would be nice to replace Mongo
# entirely with an in-process database; maybe based on Meteor's own
# "minimongo"...)
#
# We pull any needed libraries straight from the local system.
